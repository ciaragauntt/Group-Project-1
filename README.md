### MedTracker
- Application that allows you to input medication that is in use and time to take said medication. Saves on both a list and a calendar.

### User Story
- As a pharmacy patient I want an app to keep track of the medications I take daily,
So that I know the dosage and time to take medication easily.

### How to Use
- Click on the "ADD NEW MEDICATION" button to get started. Input your medication, using autofill if you need. Once you've added your medication to the list on the right, click on any of the days in the calendar to add it to that day!

### Technologies Used
- We used HTML, CSS, Skeleton CSS framework, Javascript, JQuery, JQueryUI, Moment.js, and an API from the National Library of Medicine.
